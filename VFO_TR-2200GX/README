ESP-VFO.  VFO for TR-2200GX receiption from apprx. 44.4333 - 45.1000 MHz  Proof of Concept only.

----V1.0----

The desired rxfreq = (Frequency MHz - 10.7 MHz) / 3
Output on CLK0 of Si5351. Using ESP8266 clone to have WiFi access and .91" OLED as extra.

Minimal PoC with control through webserver only. No encoder or knobs.

Sketch will:
- Initialise the Si5351 and generate the appropriate VFO frequency with low output (2MA).
- Create webserver and one page which will display the current frequency, has up/down knobs and a bunch of Presets.
- Change the frequency based on the webserver requests.

- Currently no transmit frequency is generated. Early tests showed some interference and complexity as the 
  frequency generated is frequency MHz / 12  (so the signal will interfere with the receiption) thus the signal needs 
  to be switched on only when the PTT is pressed.
  Also because the TR-2200GX is missing CTCSS and I have other rigs around the need to continue the PoC was not apperent.
  The Busy signal from the TR-2200GX can be used to switch on the TX signal but you need to have a clean(er)
  generated signal to have a good stable signal and FM modulation. So additional filtering around 12 MHz and a robust and
  jitterfree signal needs to be generated.

- To calibration de Si5351 TCXO and thus the VFO a function is available.
  The frequency will be 10 MHz (1000000000) and adjust with the knobs as close as possible.
  Save will store the cal_factor in EEPROM and reboot the VFO to the start frtequency 145.500 MHz.
  Cancel will stop the calibration and return to the last selected VFO frequency.
